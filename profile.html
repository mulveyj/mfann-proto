<p>Based in the North-West, I am a specialist costs and PI Barrister, a Mediator and a Legal Consultant/Auditor. I have a dual-practising certificate, authorising me to serve clients both in-house and by instruction.</p>
<p>I was called to the Bar in 2003, and have established and maintained a loyal following amongst clients who value my eye for detail and my consistently thorough and meticulous approach. My areas of expertise include: Costs (including at the SCCO); coronial law and inquests; multi-track cases in high value Personal Injury and Clinical Negligence cases (for both Claimants and Defendants).</p>
<p>Currently, my primary focus is on developing my Costs practice here in the North West. Broadly, my experience includes detailed assessment, oral review of provisional assessments, advising on and arguing specific points of law arising as preliminary issues (such as recoverability of additional liabilities), validity of retainers and drafting points of dispute.  I have a developing niche area of expertise in arguing the principle of costs.</p>
<p>I bring a wealth of experience from outside legal practice. Prior to being called, I served for ten years in the RAF Support Helicopter Force and I am a keen sailor with extensive offshore experience. This breadth of knowledge has served me well in PI and coronial cases concerning aviation, aircraft operations, complex occupational injuries, sailing-related accidents and injuries sustained during military operations. </p>
<p>As well as the traditional advocacy role, I can provide a range of non-standard solutions through my capabilities in mediation and in-house consultancy. Consequently, I have the versatility to provide astute, proportionate, commercially attractive advice in a format best suited to my clients' needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When not working, I enjoy spending time with my two highly energetic young sons, grabbing time to run, swim and sail when the opportunity arises.</p>
